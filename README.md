## Aim of the project

The Project was done as a teamwork collaborative project for my Natural Language Processing course at LAU.

THe project was done with my teammates Abdel Rahman Al Kadi and Nour Kallout

THe aim of this project was to demonstrate and data preprocessing, Natural Language text vectorization, and speech recognition using Python's libraries.

## Software and Libraries used

Jupyter Notebook is used to run Python's libraries to do all the data cleaning, preprocessing, and speech recognition.

## How to run

To run the project, download the jupyter notebook, open the notebook using jupyter and run all cells. However, the text file is not present in the repository so the project will fail to run as the text file will not be found. (Python, jupyter notebook and the respective Python libraries must be installed prior to running the project)

However, in the repository an html file that showcases the results of the project is already attached and it mimics the act of doing all the steps above by opening it. The only downside is that the html file is static and not susceptible to code changes.
